A survey form created as a project on freeCodeCamp

I'm not feeling too inspired by the design or content.  Definitely up for a remix

Future to-do:

- Create a more concise Grid
- Do something non standard with the design
- Add a pop up modal window on submit
- Add an animation
- Make responsive
- Style the warning pop ups for required fields (no sure where to start yet or if it's even possible)
